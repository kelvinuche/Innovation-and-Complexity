# Cancer Burden Analysis in Germany (2008-2019): Insights into Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)

## Audience: Oncologists, public health researchers, policymakers, and cancer advocacy
organizations.

## Challenge: Cancer poses a significant health burden globally, with its impact measured
not only in terms of mortality but also in years lived with disability. Understanding the
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per 100,000 individuals across different cancer
types in Germany from 2008 to 2019 is essential for assessing the overall cancer burden
and prioritizing interventions.

## Solution: Our app provides a comprehensive analysis of cancer burden rates in Germany
over the past decade. By examining DALYs per 100,000 individuals for various cancer
types, health institutions and providers can gain insights into the total burden of disease,
including years lost due to premature death and years lived with disability. This information
empowers stakeholders to prioritize resources, develop targeted treatment and prevention
strategies, and raise public awareness about cancer prevention and early detection.
Citizens can utilize this data to understand the impact of cancer on overall health and
make informed decisions about their healthcare, including screening and lifestyle choices
aimed at reducing cancer risk
